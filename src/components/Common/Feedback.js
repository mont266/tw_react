We were shown how to update the website and any questions we have are always answered quickly and with so much patience. We absolutely love our new website and honestly without the patience and dedication of Talisman Webs I dont think we would ever have gotten it up an running.'

He frequently updates the website with our products, current promotional discounts and notifies us with analytics such as the number of people visiting our website and which products our customers are most interested in. Couldnt recommend Talisman Webs enough, overall a very rapid and professional company which keeps its customers and the websites updated on a daily bases. Any requests Ive had regarding updates on the website were completed within 24 hours, couldnt get such customer service anywhere else. Wish Talisman Webs and Scott the best of luck in the future and looking forward to working alongside them in the very near future!'

We also had very bad experiences along the way and are bombarded on a daily basis which has left us sceptical about the industry sector on a whole in trying to sort out the wheat from the chaff! When a trusted advisor highly recommended them we thought we would hear what they had the say and loved everything we heard about making our website more user-friendly, engaging and having more of an SEO presence. We took the plunge and are over the moon with the new content and features which have all been accomplished in lightning fast time and with minimal hassle, where Scott in particular seemed to know exactly what we would want and need! We can now concentrate for the first time knowing that our brand is loved and cherished and is continually being worked on proactively!'
